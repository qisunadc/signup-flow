## Recommended Approach

For a professional deployment, I recommend **GitHub Pages** or **Netlify**:

- **GitHub Pages**: Free, reliable, good for open source projects
- **Netlify**: Free, fast, great for static sites, includes custom domains

## Custom Domain (Optional)

After deploying, you can add a custom domain:
1. Purchase a domain (e.g., from Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
2. Configure DNS settings to point to your hosting provider
3. Update your hosting provider's settings with your custom domain

## Security Considerations

- This is a frontend-only application
- No sensitive data is stored
- All validation is client-side
- Consider adding server-side validation for production use

## File Structure

Your project is ready to deploy as-is:
```
signup-webapp/
├── index.html      # Main HTML file
├── styles.css      # CSS styling
├── script.js       # JavaScript functionality
├── README.md       # Documentation
└── DEPLOYMENT.md   # This file
```

All files are self-contained and ready for deployment!
